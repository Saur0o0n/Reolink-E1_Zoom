Some technical information on Reoling E1 Zoom camera

Just some information on mentioned camera, sadly I was trying to find serial console - but without a luck (I've just looked for it - not much more).

Camera is "powered" by Novatek NT98515 SoC, with MS41929 stepper motor driver and sensor - all in the head of the camera. In the "foot", there is Qualcomm Atheros AR1021X board connected with USB.
